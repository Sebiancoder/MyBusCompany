This website allows you design your own bus network. It is hosted [here](https://sebiancoder.neocities.org/#).

The map and all map interactions are programmed with [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com). 

[Leaflet Routing Machine](https://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/) was used for the routing.

FileSaver.js, which is used to save json files with bus route information to the user's computer, came from [here](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/)
